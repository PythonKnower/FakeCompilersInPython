# FakeCompilersInPython
This repository shows and gives a licensed Fake Compiler folder that I create, Licensed under MIT.
## Can you copy and tweak it?
Of course not, we do not allow that, It's licensed.
You can still test things and upload better ones for Py 3.11.0 for me to test, and accept your updates!
## Can I trust it?
Of course, it doesn't compile anything!
